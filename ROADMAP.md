# Roadmap

This document defines a high level roadmap for GitLab-Controller development and upcoming releases. 
Community and contributor involvement is vital for successfully implementing all desired items for each release. 
We hope that the items listed below will inspire further engagement from the community to keep 
Crossplane progressing and shipping exciting and valuable features.

Any dates listed below and the specific issues that will ship in a given milestone are subject to change but 
should give a general idea of what we are planning. 
We use the [milestone](https://github.com/crossplaneio/gitlab-controller/milestones) feature in Github 
so look there for the most up-to-date and issue plan.
